# New Bittboy CFW Changelog

The next list is all the changes registered on the **custom firmware** version updates.

## 3.7 Beta _(May 09, 2019)_

- Borders and palette files for gambatte and ohboy moved (fixes these not being available in the emulator's setting)

- Emulator list sorting changed. Sort order can be configured by renaming the files within 'gmenu2x\sections\emulators'. All files begin with a number (eg '01-gambatte'), change numbering to change display order.
- Set default ROM path for some emulators, see emulator info below
- 2 emulator executables renamed to work with skin icons ('\emus\gambatte\gambatte-bittboy' to 'gambatte','\emus\gpsp_gameblabla\gpsp' to 'gpsp_gameblabla')
- Icon files for emulators renamed to correctly load when skin is changed (fixes skins using default skin icons rather than their own for many emulators)
