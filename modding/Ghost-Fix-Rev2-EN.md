# New Bittboy PCB rev2 **Ghost Key** hardware modification

Before working with us, we would like to express our gratitude to Steward-fu and the Retro Game Handhelds Discord Channel for developing.

**Caution**\
This operation requires soldering. 
One mistake can destroy the board forever. Only those who have knowledge of soldering are encouraged to work.

**Warning**\
The PCB v1 method of modification will operate normally immediately after booting, but soon the TA will be pressed.
