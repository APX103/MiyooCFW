# New Bittboy Rev 3 Custom Firmware

Before working with us, we would like to express our gratitude to **Steward-fu** and the **Bittboy Discord Channel** for developing.

**This is still a beta and is still in development. You can click the next video to see how to do.**

## 1) Materials
1. New Bittboy - rev3 (For rev3.5 users go to end of this file)
2. SD card of 8GB or more
3. Lastest CFW v3.6 Image [(Download)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xr1rdi4hflc9vvc/Bittboy_V3only_v3.6_beta_02-05-19.img.7z?dl=0) or CFW v3.7 Beta 2 Image [(Download)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3jmza8l3g7nxisi/Bittboy_V3only_v3.7_beta_13-05-19.img.7z?dl=0)
4. Install win32diskimager [(Download)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager)

## 2) Setup
1. Remove all partitions of SD card and format it with _FAT32_. (Using Windows Disk Management).
2. Execute _win32diskimager_, select SD driver, load the **.IMG** file and press **Write** button to proceed.
3. Once the image is burned, insert the SD into New Bittboy and turn it on. If it boots it is a success.

**Note:** You can expand you main drive to reclaim the full space use _Partition Magic_ or similar app.

## 3) Workaround for rev3.5

The lastest Bittboy comes with changes _(again)_ so is now the rev3.5 (Barcode 20190424 005). So the image for rev3 will not work on this, you will get a black screen.

Theres an small **workaround** to get it working for now. (Not guaranteed)

1. Follow all the steps to install the CFW from avobe.
2. When you are done, replace the **zimage** file with the stock one (which comes pre-installed with your console). Also you can download [(here)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/izc6066a9fpxtl8/zImage?dl=0).
3. Turn on the console.

**Enjoy!** :grin:
