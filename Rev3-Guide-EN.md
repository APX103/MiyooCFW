1. If you are using the included SD you need to remove all partitions using Partition Wizard, SD Card Formatter or Windows Disk Management.
   **Note:** SD Card need to be in_FAT 32_ format.
2. If the CFW file is compressed on **.7zip** just extract using _7zip_ before proceed.
3. Execute _win32diskimager_, select SD card, load the **.IMG** file and press **Write** button to proceed.
4. Once the image is burned on the SD card, open Partition Wizard and choose Disk Management.
5. Then right click on the _main_ partition and choose extend (Set it to the maximum) and apply.
6. Insert the SD into New Bittboy and turn it on. If it boots it is a success.

**Note:** If you have problems to access the "main" partition on Windows 7 or 8 please read [here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16083854/61264146-7d710e80-a759-11e9-99e4-de446c032818.jpg)
