# New Bittboy Rev 3 Custom Firmware

Before working with us, we would like to express our gratitude to **Steward-fu** and the **Bittboy Discord Channel** for developing.

**This is still a beta and is still in development. You can click the next video to see how to do.**

2. SD card of 8GB or more
3. Lastest CFW v3.8 Beta Image

4. Install win32diskimager [(Download)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager)

## 2) Setup
1. Remove all partitions of SD card and format it with _FAT32_. (Using Windows Disk Management).
2. Execute _win32diskimager_, select SD driver, load the **.IMG** file and press **Write** button to proceed.
3. Once the image is burned, insert the SD into New Bittboy and turn it on. If it boots it is a success.

**Note:** You can expand you main drive to reclaim the full space use _Partition Magic_ or similar app.

**Enjoy!** :grin:
